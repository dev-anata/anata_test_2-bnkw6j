# **WHY - Vision & Purpose**

## **1. Purpose & Users**

- **Primary Problem Solved**: Automating the routine collection, processing, and structuring of data from web scraping and OCR tasks to provide scalable, reliable, and programmatically accessible datasets.

- **Target Users**: Developers, data engineers, and data scientists who require programmatic access to structured datasets.

- **Value Proposition**: A robust, backend-focused system that automatically handles scraping, OCR processing, and storage, providing seamless data retrieval via APIs.

----------

# **WHAT - Core Requirements**

## **2. Functional Requirements**

### **Core Features**

The platform must:

1. **Routine Web Scraping & API Pulling**:

   - Automatically trigger daily scraping tasks via a scheduler.

   - Support fetching data from multiple APIs or websites.

   - Structure and store the scraped data in Google Cloud Storage.

   - Allow easy addition of new scraping modules for different datasets over time.

2. **PDF Ingestion & OCR Processing**:

   - Allow PDFs to be uploaded programmatically via an API.

   - Process PDFs for OCR (supporting imperfectly scanned or multi-page documents).

   - Store extracted structured data (e.g., JSON) and the original PDFs in GCS.

3. **Data Storage & Retrieval**:

   - Use Google Cloud Storage for:

     - Scraped data in structured formats (JSON, CSV).

     - Uploaded PDFs.

     - OCR-processed data (structured text).

   - Expose RESTful APIs for:

     - Retrieving structured data.

     - Triggering ad-hoc scraping or OCR tasks.

     - Querying datasets by metadata or date.

4. **Logging & Status Tracking**:

   - Track the status of scraping and OCR jobs (e.g., “Processing”, “Failed”, “Completed”).

   - Include detailed error logging for troubleshooting.

----------

# **HOW - Planning & Implementation**

## **3. Technical Foundation**

### **Required Stack Components**

1. **Backend**:

   - RESTful API for managing scraping, OCR, and data retrieval tasks.

2. **Storage**:

   - Google Cloud Storage for data and file management.

3. **Task Scheduling**:

   - Automate daily web scraping tasks using Google Cloud Scheduler or an equivalent.

4. **OCR Engine**:

   - Extract text and structured data from PDFs using OCR tools.

5. **Database**:

   - Store metadata for task tracking and data indexing.

6. **Authentication**:

   - API key-based access control for secure programmatic interaction.

7. **Web Scraping Framework**:

   - Use Python for web scraping with a modular structure to easily add new scraping scripts as the number and type of datasets grow.

----------

## **4. Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core System**

#### **Google Cloud Storage Integration**

- Set up buckets for:

  - Scraped data.

  - Uploaded PDFs.

  - OCR results.

#### **REST API**

- Provide endpoints for:

  - Triggering scraping tasks.

  - Uploading PDFs for OCR.

  - Fetching results for scraping and OCR tasks.

  - Querying task metadata and logs.

#### **Web Scraping Module**

- Use Python for modular scraping scripts.

- Automate scraping tasks using a scheduler.

- Parse and structure the data.

- Store results in GCS.

**Flexible Scraping Architecture**:

- Use a directory structure to organize scrapers by dataset type.

- Implement a common base scraper class for shared functionality (e.g., logging, storage handling).

- Add a configuration file for managing URLs, credentials, and task-specific details.

#### **OCR Processing Module**

- Allow PDFs to be uploaded via API.

- Run OCR on uploaded files.

- Store processed results in GCS.

----------

### **Phase 2: Enhancements**

#### **Flexible Scraping System**

- Add a registry of available scrapers and allow APIs to trigger specific scrapers dynamically based on user input.

- Enable per-scraper configurations stored as JSON files to handle unique requirements (e.g., login credentials, custom parsing logic).

#### **Logging & Status Tracking**

- Implement a tracking system for all tasks, including metadata and error logs.

#### **Authentication**

- Add API key-based authentication for secure access.

#### **Searchable Data Retrieval**

- Enhance APIs to support advanced queries and filters based on metadata.

----------

# **Implementation Priorities**

### **High Priority**

- Flexible scraping architecture in Python.

- API for scraping and OCR.

- Google Cloud Storage integration.

- Task scheduling for scraping.

### **Medium Priority**

- Logging and error tracking.

- Authentication with API key management.

- Advanced data retrieval capabilities.

### **Lower Priority**

- Batch PDF uploads.

- Detailed analytics on scraping/OCR performance.

- Retry mechanisms for failed tasks.

----------

# **System Requirements**

1. **Performance**:

   - Process scraping and OCR tasks within a daily window.

2. **Scalability**:

   - Support the addition of multiple datasets and scraping logic without modifying core infrastructure.

3. **Security**:

   - Encrypted storage and secure API access.

4. **Reliability**:

   - Ensure platform uptime and robust error handling.

----------

# **Long-Term Scalability**

1. **Adding New Datasets**:

   - Use a plug-and-play approach for adding new scraping modules.

   - Ensure all scrapers follow a standardized format for easy integration.

2. **Storage Optimization**:

   - Implement lifecycle rules in GCS for archiving or deleting old data to optimize costs.

3. **Task Orchestration**:

   - Use a task queue (e.g., Celery or Google Pub/Sub) to handle concurrent scraping tasks for multiple datasets.

4. **API Versioning**:

   - Implement versioning for APIs to allow seamless updates as new features are added.
