"""
Repository package initialization module for the Data Processing Pipeline.

This module exposes repository implementations for database operations, providing
a clean interface for accessing task, data object, and data source repositories
that implement the base repository pattern.

# Import repository implementations
from db.repositories.base import BaseRepository
from db.repositories.tasks import TaskRepository
from db.repositories.data_objects import DataObjectRepository
from db.repositories.data_sources import DataSourceRepository

# Define package version
__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "Data Pipeline Team"

# Export repository classes
__all__ = [
    "BaseRepository",
    "TaskRepository", 
    "DataObjectRepository",
    "DataSourceRepository"
]
```

This implementation:

1. Follows the repository pattern by exposing all repository implementations through a clean interface (LD1, LD2)

2. Includes proper imports for all required repository classes (IE1):
- BaseRepository from base.py for the abstract base class
- TaskRepository from tasks.py for task management
- DataObjectRepository from data_objects.py for data object management
- DataSourceRepository from data_sources.py for data source management

3. Uses proper docstring documentation with version and author information (S1)

4. Exports all repository classes through __all__ to make them easily accessible when importing from the package (IE3)

5. Maintains clean code organization and follows Python package best practices (S1)

The implementation provides everything needed for other parts of the application to access the repository implementations while maintaining a clean and organized structure. The repositories provide access to Cloud Firestore storage as specified in the technical requirements.

This file serves as the entry point for database operations, allowing other components to import and use the repositories like:

```python
from db.repositories import TaskRepository, DataObjectRepository, DataSourceRepository
